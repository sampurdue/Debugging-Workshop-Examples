DDD Debugging Examples

The files in this folder all have errors in them that
you must find using the DDD debugger.  All of them
should be fairly familiar problems in order to
make the code familiar to you.  Make sure that you
understand what the code is trying to do before you
try to debug it.  

As the numbers of the files increase, the bugs get
harder to find.  However, all the bugs are basic 
mistakes that anyone could easily make while writing
a piece of code for the first time.  

All the files can be compiled using GCC with no special
command line options.  To use DDD, make sure to
include the -g option to include symbols.

You can also debug these programs using printfs.
